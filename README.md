# LinguaVerse
An international translator powered by AI.

LinguaVerse is a translator app that uses Artificial Intelligence. It can translate text between languages.

The code prompts the user to input the text, the language to translate from, and the language to translate to.
A function translates the text using AI to perform the translation. The translated text is returned by the function.

LinguaVerse uses a Python module called translate which is powered by AI. The translator uses the languages, text provided and the AI to convert it into a different language. The translator also uses iso639-lang to convert the names of languages into usable codes.
